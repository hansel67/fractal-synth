# fractal-synth

this is a simple synth coded in python that features some fractal waveforms

it uses the struct and wave libraries to render a .wav file

simply enter the desired filename in the filename variable, desired function of x in the samples[i] variable, and then run the program

thanks for taking a look! feel free to message me
